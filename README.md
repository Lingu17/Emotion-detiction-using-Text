# Emotion Detection from Text

This repository provides a simple and effective way to detect emotions in text using machine learning or natural language processing techniques. The goal is to analyze sentences or paragraphs and determine the emotional tone—such as happiness, sadness, anger, or surprise—expressed by the writer.

## Features

- Detects multiple emotions from user-provided text
- Easy-to-use interface or API (depending on implementation)
- Can be trained or fine-tuned on custom datasets
- Supports English (extendable to other languages)

## How It Works

The system takes a piece of text as input and analyzes it using a pre-trained machine learning or deep learning model. It outputs the most likely emotion(s) associated with the text. You can use it to analyze tweets, chat messages, reviews, or any other form of written communication.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   https://github.com/Lingu17/Emotion-detiction-using-Text.git

2. Install required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

You can use the model in two main ways:

#### 1. Command-Line Interface

```bash
python detect_emotion.py "I am so excited about the concert tonight!"
```
This will print the detected emotion(s) for your input text.

#### 2. As a Python Module

```python
from emotion_detector import detect_emotion

text = "I'm feeling a bit down today."
emotion = detect_emotion(text)
print(f"Detected emotion: {emotion}")
```

### Example Output

```
Input: "I'm thrilled to see you!"
Detected emotion: Joy
```

## Training & Customization

If you want to train the model with your own data:

1. Prepare your dataset (CSV or JSON) with text and labeled emotions.
2. Follow the instructions in `train_model.md` (see file for details).
3. Replace the pre-trained model with your custom-trained model.

## Applications

- Social media analysis
- Customer feedback
- Chatbots and virtual assistants
- Mental health monitoring
